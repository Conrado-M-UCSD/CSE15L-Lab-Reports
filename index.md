# CSE 15 Lab Report Week 2
## By Conrado Martinez

In this document, you will learn how to install and make use of VSCode, connect to and run commands from IENG6, transfer files using scp, and generate SSH keys for passwordless login. 

**Let's get started!**

## Task 1: Getting Started With VSCode

Visual Studio Code is an application that allows us to write code, see previews of markdown text, and run commands from our terminal. 
Now, we will cover the app's installation process. 
1. Visit the VSCode [download page](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) and download the app which corresponds to your operating system version (in my case, I will download the Windows 64-bit installer).

## Task 2: Establish A Remote Connection to `IENG6` Servers

IENG6 are the servers provided by UCSD for students to access remotely. In order to connect to the server, we must run commands on our client system which grant us a Secure Shell (SSH) into the servers. Once enrolled in an applicable course, students are given an account to access the server from. The general format for these usernames is: CSxxyyzz where x is the course number (i.e. 15L for CSE15L), y is the quarter taken (i.e. sp22 for a course taken in Spring 2022) and z will be the unique account letters (i.e. ab, .., yz, etc).
