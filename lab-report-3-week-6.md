# Lab Report 3: Increasingly Efficient!

So far, our lab activities have leveraged our skills in many common workflow scenarios, like connecting to a remote server and making use of GitHub for verion control and continuous integration. For many tasks that one would complete using these skills, there are ways we can spend less time on the "in-betweens" of software devolpment and focus on the main task at hand. In this Lab Report, I'll explore some of the ways this can be done. Specifically, I'll be *Streamlining My SSH Configuration*, *Setting up GitHub Access from ieng6*, and *copying whole directories using `scp -r`*. So let's get started!


## Task 1: Streamlining SSH Configuration

Logging into our specific ieng6 account can be tedious and can take up a large chunk of time (especially when I forget my account name or type it incorrectly :D. In order to speed up this process, I streamlined my ssh connection by configuring. Here are the photos 

1. SHOW CONFIG IN TEXT EDITOR
2. SHOW SSH LOGIN W/ ALIAS
3. SHOW SCP TRANSFER W/ ALIAS


# Task 2: 

# Task 3: 

We can also speed up our tasks by copying whole directories using `scp -r` which will recursively copy the contents of the specified directory. This method is greatly prefered over having to scp each individual file (especially when working with many files and directories).
